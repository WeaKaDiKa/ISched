            <p>Orthodontic treatment remains an elective procedure. It, like other treatments of the body, has some inherent risk and limitations. 
            These seldom prevent treatment, but should be considered in making the decision to undergo treatment.</p>
            
            <h2>PREDICTABLE FACTORS THAT CAN AFFECT THE OUTCOME OF ORTHODONTIC TREATMENT:</h2>
            <p><strong style="font-weight: bold">Cooperation:</strong> In the vast majority of orthodontic cases, significant improvement can be achieved with the patient's cooperation. 
            Thus, patient's care and discipline is a great factor of success in orthodontic treatment. 
            The dentist may in anytime terminate the treatment if the patient is uncooperative.</p>

            <p><strong style="font-weight: bold">Caring for appliances:</strong> Poor brushing increases the risk of decay when wearing braces. Excellent oral hygiene., reduction in sugar, being selective in diet, and reporting any loose bands as soon as noticed, will help minimize decay, white spots, decalcification, and gum diseases/problems. 
            *Routine visits every 3-6 months to your dentist for cleaning and cavity checks are vital during treatment and are NOT inclusive in the orthodontic procedure fee/package.</p>

            <p><strong style="font-weight: bold">Wearing mouthguards/Elastics:</strong> These are forces placed/applied on the teeth so they will move into their proper positions. 
            The amount of time mouth guard worn affects the results. Loss, damage to mouth guard are subject to fees for replacements. 
            Non replacements of elastics causes plaque build up and procedure no corrective forces to the teeth.</p>

            <p><strong style="font-weight: bold">Dislodged Brackets/ Wire Breakage/ Loss of Appliance:</strong> Any loss, damage, breakage, or need of replacements 
            due to patients neglect or other factors are subject for a fee of <strong style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">â‚±500</strong> thoroughly explained by the dentist.</p>

            <p><strong style="font-weight: bold">Appointments MUST be kept:</strong> Missed appointments create many scheduling problems and lengthen treatment time. 
            The dentist has the right to terminate orthodontic treatment if a patient missed his/her appointments within a period of 3 months.</p>

            <p><strong style="font-weight: bold">Going to ANOTHER DENTIST:</strong> At any event that the patient goes to another dentist during the course of treatment without the knowledge/proper endorsement of the attending dentist and doesn't return for check-ups and adjustments thereafter. 
            The attending dentist has the right to claim against patient for breach in the course of treatment.</p>

            <h2>UNPREDICTABLE FACTORS THAT CAN AFFECT THE OUTCOME OF ORTHODONTIC TREATMENT:</h2>
            <p><strong style="font-weight: bold">Muscle habits:</strong> Mouth breathing, thumb, finger or lip sucking, tongue thrusting and other unusual habits can prevent teeth from moving to their corrected positions or cause relapse after braces are removed.</p>

            <p><strong style="font-weight: bold">Facial Growth Patterns:</strong> Unusual skeletal patterns and insufficient or undesirable facial growth can compromise the dental results, affect a facial change and causes shifting of teeth during retention. Surgical assistance may be recommended in these situations.</p>

            <p><strong style="font-weight: bold">Post Treatment Tooth Movement:</strong> Teeth have a tendency to shift or settle after treatment as well as after retention. Some changes are desirable; others are not. 
            Rotations and crowding of the lower front teeth or slight space in the extraction site are common examples.</p>

            <p><strong style="font-weight: bold">Temporomandibular Problems (TMJ):</strong> Possible TMJ or jaw joint problems may develop before, during, or after orthodontic treatment. 
            Tooth positions, bite, or pre-existing TMJ in this condition.</p>

            <p><strong style="font-weight: bold">Impacted teeth:</strong> In an attempt to move impacted teeth, (teeth unable to erupt normally), especially cuspids and third molars (wisdom teeth, various problems are sometimes encountered which may lead to periodontal problems, relapse, or loss of tooth.</p>
            
            <p><strong style="font-weight: bold">Nonvital or Dead Tooth:</strong> A traumatized or other causes can die over a long period of time or without orthodontic treatment. 
            This tooth may discolor or flared up during orthodontic treatment. It could deteriorate during treatment causing loss of bone around the tooth. Excellent oral hygiene and frequent scaling and polishing by your dentist can help control this situation.</p>
