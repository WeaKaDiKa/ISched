    <h1>Informed Consent</h1>
    <div class="terms-box">

      <h2>TREATMENT TO BE DONE: </h2>
      <p>I understand and consent to have any treatment done by the dentist after the procedure, the risks & benefits &
        cost have been fully explained. These treatments include, but are not limited to, x-rays, cleanings, periodontal
        treatments, fillings, crowns, bridges, all types of extraction, root canals, &/or dentures, local anesthetics &
        surgical cases.</p>

      <h2>DRUGS & MEDICATIONS: </h2>
      <p>I understand that antibiotics, analgesics & other medications can cause allergic reactions like redness &
        swelling of tissues, pain, itching, vomiting, &/or anaphylactic shock.</p>

      <h2>CHANGES IN TREATMENT PLAN: </h2>
      <p>I understand that during treatment it may be necessary to change/add procedures because or conditions found
        while working on the teeth that was not discovered during examination. For example, root canal therapy may be
        needed following routine restorative procedures. I give my permission to the dentist to make any/all changes and
        additions as necessary w/ my responsibility to pay all the costs agreed.</p>

      <h2>RADIOGRAPH: </h2>
      <p>4I understand that alternatives to tooth removal (root canal therapy, crown & periodontal surgery, etc.) & I
        completely understand these alternatives, including their risk & benefits prior to authorizing the dentist to
        remove teeth & any other structures necessary for reasons above. I understand that removing teeth does not
        always remove all the infections, if present, & it may be necessary to have further treatment. I understand the
        risk involved in having teeth removed, such as pain swelling, spread of infection, dry socket, fractured jaw,
        loss of feeling on the teeth, lips tongue & surrounding tissue that can last for an indefinite period of time. I
        understand that I may need further treatment under a specialist if complications arise during or following
        treatment.</p>

      <h2>REMOVAL TEETH: </h2>
      <p>I understand that alternatives to tooth removal (root canal therapy, crown & periodontal surgery, etc.) & I
        completely understand these alternatives, including their risk & benefits prior to authorizing the dentist to
        remove teeth & any other structures necessary for reasons above. I understand that removing teeth does not
        always remove all the infections, if present, & it may be necessary to have further treatment. I understand the
        risk involved in having teeth removed, such as pain swelling, spread of infection, dry socket, fractured jaw,
        loss of feeling on the teeth, lips tongue & surrounding tissue that can last for an indefinite period of time. I
        understand that I may need further treatment under a specialist if complications arise during or following
        treatment.</p>

      <h2>CROWNS (CAPS) & BRIDGES: </h2>
      <p>preparing a tooth may irritate the nerve tissue in the center of the tooth, leaving the tooth extra sensitive
        to heat, cold & pressure. Treating such irritation may involve using special toothpaste, mouth rinses or root
        canal therapy. I understand that sometimes it is not possible to match the color of natural teeth exactly with
        artificial teeth. I further understand that I may be wearing temporary crowns, which may come off easily & that
        I must be careful to ensure that they are kept on until the permanent crowns are delivered. It is my
        responsibility to return for permanent cementation within 20 days from tooth preparation, as excessive days
        delay may allow for tooth movement, which may necessitate bridge/ cap. I understand there will be additional
        charges for remakes due to my delaying of permanent cementation, & I realize remake of the crown, that final
        opportunity to make changes in my new crown, bridges or cap (including shape, fit, size & color) will be before
        permanent cementation. </p>

      <h2>ENDODONTICS (ROOT CANAL): </h2>
      <p>I understand there is no guarantee that a root canal treatment will save a tooth & that complications can occur
        from the treatment & that occasionally root canal filling material may extend through the tooth which does not
        necessarily effect the success of the treatment. I understand that endodontic files & drills are very fine
        instruments & stresses vented in their manufacture & calcifications present in teeth can cause them to break
        during use. I understand that referral to the endodontist for additional treatments may be necessary following
        any root canal treatment & I agree that I am responsible for any additional cost for treatment performed by the
        endodontist. I understand that a tooth may require removal in spite of all efforts to save it.</p>

      <h2>PERIODONTAL DISEASE: </h2>
      <p>I understand that periodontal disease is a serious condition causing gum & bone inflammation &/or loss & that
        can lead eventually to the loss of my teeth. I understand the alternative treatment plans to correct periodontal
        disease, including gum surgery tooth extractions with or without replacement. I understand that undertaking any
        dental procedures may have future adverse effect on my periodontal conditions.</p>

      <h2>FILLINGS: </h2>
      <p>I understand that care must be exercised in chewing on fillings, especially during the first 24 hours to avoid
        breakage. I understand that a more extensive filling or a crown may be required, as additional decay or fracture
        may become evident after initial excavation. I understand that significant sensitivity is a common, but usually
        temporary, after-effect of a newly place filling. I further understand that filling a tooth may irritate the
        nerve tissue creating sensitivity & treating such sensitivity could require root canal therapy or extractions.
      </p>

      <h2>DENTURES: </h2>
      <p>I understand that wearing or dentures can be difficult. Sore spots, altered speech & difficulty in eating are
        common problems. Immediate dentures (placement of denture immediately after extractions) may be painful,
        immediate dentures may require considerable adjusting & several relines. I understand that it is my
        responsibility to return for delivery of dentures. I understand that failure to keep my delivery appointment may
        result in poorly fitted dentures. if a remake is required due to my delays of more than 30 days, there will be
        additional charges. A permanent reline will be needed later, which is not included in the initial fee. I
        understand that all adjustment or alteration of any kind this initial period is subject to changes.</p>

      <h2>NO RETURN, NO REFUND POLICY: </h2>
      <p>Please do remember that we do not sell any products here in our clinic. We are Dental Doctors who provide
        dental services. This is the reason why we do not refund any amount of money. Because we are providing service
        that is non-refundable.</p>

      <h2>Note: </h2>
      <p>We give considerations to be discussed by our dentist. I understand that dentistry is not an exact science and
        that no dentist can properly guarantee accurate results all the time. I hereby authorize any of the
        doctors/dental auxiliaries to proceed with & perform the dental restoration & treatments as explained to me. I
        understand that these are subject to modification depending on undiagnosable circumstances that may arise during
        the course of treatment. I understand that regardless of any dental insurance coverage I may have, I am
        responsible for payment of dental fees, I agree to pay any attorney's fees, collection fee, or court costs that
        may be incurred to satisfy any obligation to this office. All treatment were properly explained to me & any
        untoward circumstances that may arise during the procedure, the attending dentist will no be held liable since
        it is my free will, with full trust & confidence in him/her, to undergo dental treatment under his/her care.</p>
